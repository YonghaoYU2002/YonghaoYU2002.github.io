### A short introduction of myself
I am currently a first-year student in Master of Science in Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), specializing in Public Health Data Science. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Data Science and minor degree in Mathematics from the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics, machine learning, and statistical analysis. My coursework and research have honed my skills in Python, MATLAB, R, and SQL, and I have applied these tools to a range of data science projects.

I have hands-on research experience, including work on the investigation of the convergence rate of Central Limit Theorem and image processing, where I reimplemented complex MATLAB scripts in Python to improve research efficiency. Additionally, during my internship at ByteDance, I contributed to the design of an e-commerce platform by leveraging data-driven insights to help merchants enhance their advertising strategies.

In my various projects, I have tackled real-world challenges, such as predicting customer churn and detecting credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms. My technical proficiency extends beyond coding; I am skilled in data visualization tools like Tableau and Gephi, and I am passionate about using data to drive impactful solutions.

Fluent in Mandarin and English, with beginner-level Cantonese, I am committed to advancing my expertise in biostatistics and data science to contribute meaningfully to public health initiatives.
